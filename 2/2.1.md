## 2.1 Setting up your development environment

### 2.1.1 Get the code and run a local build

GoCD requires the following software packages to build

-   JDK 7 (OpenJDK or Oracle)
-   Git (1.7+)
-   NodeJS (>=0.10)
-   Ruby (>= 1.9.3), optional

Assuming the codebase is cloned into `~/projects/go`, you need to execute the
following commands to build GoCD

```bash
~/projects/go$ unset GEM_HOME GEM_PATH
~/projects/go$ ./gradlew clean agentGenericZip serverGenericZip
```

After a successful build, the build artifacts are generated inside `target/` sub-directories within individual module directories and the ZIP installers for GoCD Server and GoCD Agent are generated inside `installers/target/distributions/zip/`.

```bash
~/projects/go$ find . -name target -type d
./addon-api/database/target
./agent/target
...
./tfs-impl/target
./util/target
~/projects/go$ ls installers/target/distributions/zip/
go-agent-16.7.0-3795.zip  go-server-16.7.0-3795.zip
```

### 2.1.2 Setup IntelliJ

If you have IntelliJ IDEA configured, you can, optionally, use it to build GoCD.

Prior to build via the IDE, we would have to prepare the working directory by copying the database deltas to the
configured location. You can achieve this by running the  following command in the working directory:

```bash
~/projects/go$ ./gradlew clean prepare fatJar -PfastBuild
```

After the preparation phase has succeeded,

- Open the project in IDEA
- Build -> Rebuild project

### 2.1.3 Running Development Server via IntelliJ IDEA

When developing using IntelliJ IDEA, it is always convenient to run the GoCD Server in *development mode*. Apart from the convenience, you also get

- Live debugging
- Faster feedback
- Hot-swapping changes while the JVM is up

The IDEA **Application** run-configuration can be setup using the values below:

```
Name: Development Server
Main Class: com.thoughtworks.go.server.DevelopmentServer
VM options: -Xms512m -Xmx1024m -XX:PermSize=400m
Working directory: <project-directory>/server
Environment variables: GEM_PATH=;GEM_HOME=;
Use classpath of module: development-server
```

### 2.1.4 Running Development Agent via IntelliJ IDEA

The IDEA **Application** run-configuration can be setup using the values below:

```
Name: Development Agent
Main Class: com.thoughtworks.go.agent.DevelopmentAgent
Working directory: <project-directory>/agent
Use classpath of module: development-agent
```

### 2.1.5 Running RSpec tests from the command line

Here are some rspec specific commands you may find useful —

```bash
$ ./gradlew rspec # run all specs, with default arguments
$ ./gradlew rspec -Popts='--pattern spec/**/api_v**/*_spec.rb' # to run api specs
$ ./gradlew rspec -Popts='--pattern spec/controllers' # to run controller specs
$ ./gradlew rspec -Popts='--pattern spec/foo/bar_spec.rb' # to run a single spec
```

### 2.1.5 Running RSpec tests from IntelliJ

1. First ensure that your JRuby SDK is setup properly

    ```
    Ruby interpreter path: <project-directory>/tools/rails/bin/jruby
    Language level: 1.9
    Gems bin directory: <project-directory>/tools/rails/bin
    ```

2. Configure the default RSpec run configuration

  1. Open `Run -> Edit configurations...`
  2. Open the `Defaults` section and select `RSpec` in the listing
  3. Check the `Use custom RSpec runner script` checkbox
  4. Select `rspec` from `~/projects/go/tools/bin/rspec`
  5. Set the working directory to `~/projects/go/server/webapp/WEB-INF/rails.new`
     ![](images/idea-configure-rspec.png)
  6. Click `Apply` to save
  7. Open a spec file and run it `Run -> Run 'somefile_spec.rb'`, or `Ctrl+Shift+F10`
